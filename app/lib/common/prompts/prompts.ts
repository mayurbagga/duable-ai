## üåä FLOW BLOCKCHAIN INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS - THREE-PHASE DEPLOYMENT

### CRITICAL: Every application MUST follow the three-phase Web3 deployment workflow

üîÑ **PHASE 1: SINGLE COMPREHENSIVE SMART CONTRACT GENERATION**
- Generate ONE comprehensive Cadence smart contract containing ALL application functions
- Include all business logic: create, read, update, delete, mint, buy, sell, transfer operations
- DO NOT create multiple contracts - consolidate everything into one contract
- Smart contracts are generated separately from the application
- Contract should be modular and deployment-agnostic

üöÄ **PHASE 2: PARENT APP DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION**
- Deployment is handled EXCLUSIVELY by the parent Cosmiq app, NOT the mini-app
- User clicks "Deploy Contract" button above the application panel
- Deployment uses user's connected Flow wallet credentials
- Real-time deployment status tracking via parent app
- Mini-app NEVER attempts to deploy contracts itself

üîó **PHASE 3: ADDRESS INJECTION & INTEGRATION**
- Deployed contract address is automatically captured by parent app
- Address is injected into ALL frontend components that need blockchain functionality
- All contract interactions (mint, buy, sell, transfer, etc.) use the injected deployed address
- Complete seamless integration without manual code modification

### FLOW SETUP REQUIREMENTS:

#### 1. Package Installation
Install these Flow packages at the start:
${FLOW_PACKAGES.map((pkg) => `- ${pkg}`).join('\n')}

#### 2. Cadence 1.0 Authorization Requirements
CRITICAL: All transactions must use proper authorization entitlements:
- **Contract Operations**: \`auth(Contracts) &Account\` for contract deployment
- **Storage Operations**: \`auth(Storage) &Account\` for account storage access
- **General Transactions**: \`auth(Storage) &Account\` for most user transactions
- **Resource Operations**: Proper entitlements based on resource requirements

#### 3. Flow Configuration
Create flow-config.js/ts with:
\`\`\`javascript
import { config } from '@onflow/fcl';

// Configure for Flow Testnet
config({
  'accessNode.api': 'https://rest-testnet.onflow.org',
  'discovery.wallet': 'https://fcl-discovery.onflow.org/testnet/authn',
  'app.detail.title': 'Your App Name',
  'app.detail.icon': 'https://your-app-icon.com/icon.png',
  'service.OpenID.scopes': 'email',
  'fcl.limit': 1000
});

export { config as fcl };
\`\`\`

#### 3. Flow Authentication Context
Create a FlowAuthContext that provides:
- User authentication state
- Login/logout functions
- User account information
- Transaction signing capabilities

#### 4. Authentication Guard
Create an AuthGuard component that:
- Redirects unauthenticated users to login
- Shows Flow wallet connection interface
- Manages authentication state

#### 5. Smart Contract Generation (Phase 1)
Based on the application context, create a relevant Cadence smart contract:
- **E-commerce**: Product catalog, payment processing
- **Social Media**: Post creation, user profiles, interactions
- **Gaming**: Player stats, achievements, leaderboards
- **Finance**: Token management, transactions, balances
- **Music**: Artist profiles, album releases, royalties
- **Art/NFT**: Artwork minting, marketplace, collections
- **Real Estate**: Property listings, ownership tracking
- **Supply Chain**: Product tracking, authenticity verification

### SMART CONTRACT TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:

\`\`\`cadence
// Contract should be relevant to the application
access(all) contract [AppName]Contract {

    // Events for logging
    access(all) event ContractDeployed(message: String)
    access(all) event [RelevantEvent](data: String)

    // State variables relevant to the app
    access(all) var [relevantState]: String

    // Initialization
    init() {
        self.[relevantState] = "Initial value"
        emit ContractDeployed(message: "Contract deployed successfully")
        log("‚úÖ [AppName]Contract deployed successfully")
    }

    // App-specific functions
    access(all) fun [relevantFunction](): String {
        log("üîÑ [relevantFunction] called")
        emit [RelevantEvent](data: "Function executed")
        return "Success"
    }

    // Admin functions if needed
    access(all) fun updateState(newValue: String) {
        self.[relevantState] = newValue
        log("üìù State updated to: ".concat(newValue))
    }

    // Resource-based functionality for advanced use cases
    access(all) resource [ResourceName] {
        access(all) let id: UInt64

        init() {
            self.id = self.uuid
        }
    }

    // Function to create resources
    access(all) fun create[ResourceName](): @[ResourceName] {
        return <- create [ResourceName]()
    }
}
\`\`\`

### THREE-PHASE DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW:

**Phase 1: Smart Contract Generation**
1. **Contract Creation**: Generate secure, production-ready smart contract
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep contract logic separate from deployment
3. **Contract Validation**: Ensure contract follows security best practices

**Phase 2: Deployment Execution (Parent App)**
1. **Deploy Contract Button**: Prominently displayed above application panel
2. **Wallet Integration**: Uses user's connected Flow wallet from parent app
3. **Real-time Status**: Live deployment progress and transaction tracking
4. **Error Handling**: Clear feedback for deployment failures

**Phase 3: Address Propagation**
1. **Address Capture**: Automatically capture deployed contract address
2. **Code Injection**: Inject address into all relevant frontend components
3. **Contract Integration**: Wire up all contract interactions with deployed address
4. **Verification**: Ensure all contract calls use the correct deployed address

### REQUIRED COMPONENTS:

1. **WalletLogin.tsx**: Flow wallet authentication interface
2. **FlowAuthContext.tsx**: Authentication state management
3. **AuthGuard.tsx**: Protected route wrapper
4. **Contract Interface**: Component for contract interaction (address injected post-deployment)

### INTEGRATION PATTERN:

\`\`\`javascript
// App.tsx or main component
import { FlowAuthProvider } from './contexts/FlowAuthContext';
import { AuthGuard } from './components/AuthGuard';

function App() {
  return (
    <FlowAuthProvider>
      <AuthGuard>
        {/* Main app content with contract interaction */}
        <MainAppContent />
      </AuthGuard>
    </FlowAuthProvider>
  );
}
\`\`\`

### CONTRACT INTERACTION PATTERN:

\`\`\`javascript
// Contract interactions using injected address
const ContractInteraction = ({ contractAddress }) => {
  const executeContract = async () => {
    if (!contractAddress) {
      console.error('Contract address not available - deployment required');
      return;
    }

    // Use injected contract address for all interactions
    const result = await fcl.mutate({
      cadence: \`
        import [AppName]Contract from \${contractAddress}

        transaction() {
          prepare(signer: auth(Storage) &Account) {
            // Prepare authorization if needed
          }
          execute {
            [AppName]Contract.[relevantFunction]()
          }
        }
      \`,
      args: (arg, t) => []
    });

    return result;
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={executeContract}>
      {contractAddress ? 'Execute Contract' : 'Deploy Contract First'}
    </button>
  );
};
\`\`\`

### CONSOLE LOGGING REQUIREMENTS:

Every smart contract function must include:
- log() statements for debugging
- Event emissions for tracking
- Success/error messages
- Transaction status updates

### DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION:

After Phase 2 deployment, verify:
1. Console shows contract deployment logs
2. Transaction ID is displayed
3. Events are emitted correctly
4. Contract address is captured and injected
5. Frontend components can interact with deployed contract

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

‚ùå **DO NOT**:
- Embed deployment logic in the generated frontend
- Attempt to deploy contracts within the mini-app
- Hardcode contract addresses in the generated code
- Create deployment interfaces within the generated app

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Generate smart contracts separately from deployment
- Use placeholder contract addresses that get replaced post-deployment
- Create contract interaction components that accept injected addresses
- Ensure all contract calls are address-parameterized
- Design for seamless address injection after deployment

This three-phase architecture ensures secure, scalable Web3 application development with proper separation of concerns.
